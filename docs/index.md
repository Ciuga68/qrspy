# Welcome to QRSpy

QRSpy is a Python built wrapper for the Qlik Sense Repository Service API.

The Qlik Sense Repository Service (QRS) contains all data and configuration information for a Qlik Sense site. The data is normally added and updated using the Qlik Management Console (QMC) or a Qlik Sense client, but it is also possible to communicate directly with the QRS using its API.

QRSpy supports authenticating to the Qlik Sense Repository Service APIs by either certificates that have been exported in PEM format or Windows Authentication (NTLM).
