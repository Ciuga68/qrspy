# Welcome to QSRpy

QSRpy is a Python built wrapper for the Qlik Sense Repository Service API.

The Qlik Sense Repository Service (QRS) contains all data and configuration information for a Qlik Sense site. The data is normally added and updated using the Qlik Management Console (QMC) or a Qlik Sense client, but it is also possible to communicate directly with the QRS using its API.

To access the project go here: https://github.com/clintcarr/qlik-qsr-python
